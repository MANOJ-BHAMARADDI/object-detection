# 📱 Real-Time Phone Detection with YOLOv8

This project uses **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once) to detect mobile phones in real-time using a webcam. Built in Python with OpenCV and Ultralytics.

![Demo](https://github.com/MANOJ-BHAMARADDI/object-detection/raw/main/demo.gif) <!-- You can replace this with a real gif/screenshot later -->

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time object detection from webcam
- Detects `cell phones` (and other COCO objects using `yolov8n.pt`)
- Draws bounding boxes and calculates FPS
- Modular and beginner-friendly code

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/MANOJ-BHAMARADDI/object-detection.git
cd object-detection

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
```

---

## 🎯 Usage

```bash
python phone_detector.py
```

Then:
- Hold a phone in front of your webcam 📱
- Press `Q` to exit

## 🧠 Want to Train Your Own Model?

You can collect your own dataset and train YOLOv8 with:

```bash
yolo detect train data=data.yaml model=yolov8n.pt epochs=50 imgsz=640
```

Then replace `yolov8n.pt` with your new `best.pt`.
